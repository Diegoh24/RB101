=begin

1. Ruby creates an object_id to store the value of the variable. the variable points to the object_id
a and c will have the same, object_id
although b has the same value, it points to a different object_id

2.
Numbers are immutable, so all referencec the same immmutable integer 42

3.
My string looks like this now: "pumpkins"
My array looks like this now: ["pumpkins", "rutabaga"]

a_string_param creates a new String object.

The method uses the '<<' operator which mutates the caller, so it changes the  value that 'an_array_param'
points to

4. THe ["pumpkins", "rutabage"] is a new object and it is assigned to the local variable my_array_param

5. Return the value of the modified variables and store them in the original variables

6.
